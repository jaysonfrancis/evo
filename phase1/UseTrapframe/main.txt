/* Instruction pointer, and the stack pointer, are the most impotant pointers in the cpu. The switching is between the kernel code and the process code 
Instruction Pointer --> Instruction
Stack Pointer --> Stack 
There is a proces code that runs in the process space. The switching to this process,
Instruction --> Idle, UserProc
IDT --> TimerEntryCode (Begining of the interrupt handling), eventually going to kenerl code
Inside kernel code, call subroutines, (Interrupt service routine).. Kernels dutie is to load process
Runtime stack is always being used to do the push and pop. 

include statements...
declare kernel data structures...
(include stuff from timer lab and new PCB described in 1.html)

(some needed subroutines here, prototype them in main.h)
InitData() still the same as PureSimulation

SelectCRP() still the same as PureSimulation

SetEntry() needed from timer lab

InitIDT() is new to code, containing 3 statements from timer lab:
   locate IDT
   fill out IDT timer entry
   program PIC mask
   (but NO "sti")

int main() {
   call InitData() to initialize kernel data structure
   call (new) InitIDT() to set up timer (from timer lab)
   call CreateISR() to create Idle proc
   call Dispatch(pcb[...) to load Idle proc to run

   return 0;
} // main ends

void Kernel(TF_t *TF_ptr) {
   change to kernel mode for CRP
   save TF_ptr to PCB of CRP

   switch upon intr_num pointed by TF_ptr to call corresponging ISR {
      if it's TIMER_INTR:
         call TimerISR()
      default:
         PANIC! msg and break into GDB
   }

// still handles other keyed-in simulated events
   (same as PureSimulation to handle key events)

   call SelectCRP() to select process to run
   call Dispatch(pcb[CRP].TF_ptr) to load it and run
}
